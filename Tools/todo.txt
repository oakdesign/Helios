intro to zeen
- objective
	- a single set of exported viewports with unique names for all planes
- viewport hack style
- patch
	- DCS versions
- Templates

questions to CZ
- naming
	- makes sense to CZ

- standard set somewhere defined already?
	- Jabbers launcher may have a set, CZ may have beta access
*	- CZ reaching out to jabbers
		- standard list of viewport names and modern (ViewportHandling.lua) exports
		- viewport reference sizes for appropriate viewport rectangle shape

- use ViewportHandling.lua everywhere?
	- makes sense to CZ

- how to get reference sizes?
	- maybe just manual process for now
	- CZ uses bitmaps of the bezel art from DCS or flattened model viewer screenshots to measure

- how to support new planes
	- must not require Helios build
	- additional viewport patches in Helios documents folder supported
		- or embedded in the profile? <- better

- incompatible DCS versions
	- how does CZ handle it now?
		- makes a new profile update
		- maintains old version of profile for a while
