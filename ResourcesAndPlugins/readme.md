This library is an empty DLL that is not to be distributed.  It is just a grouping of all the 
dependencies that we want to build before executing any of the executables
(Profile Editor, Control Center, future others.)

Since Utility projects appear to require the C++ Desktop workload in Visual Studio, this empty
C# project is used instead of a more proper utility project.
