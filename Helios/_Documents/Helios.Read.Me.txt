Helios 1.6 is not an explicit collaboration with Craig Courtney, 
but it relies heavily on the original Helios.  This distribution is not endorsed 
by Craig Courtney.  
                                                                     
If you encounter problems, please check for known issues here 
https://github.com/BlueFinBima/helios/issues and if nothing appears to be 
relevant then open a new issue.
  
* * * After Installation * * *

1) The KeypressReceiver.exe is used for receiving Helios keypresses 
when DCS is installed on a separate PC.  
There is an installer for the KeyPress Receiver for installing it on your PC running.
Set the server IP address to the IP address of your Helios PC and open port 9088 
(fixed port for now) on the Helios PC.
The receiver is not required for instances where Helios runs on the DCS PC.

2) if you continue to use a custom Export.Lua and want to take advantage of the 
added "Disconnect" event then modify your export.lua to contain:
<code>
function LuaExportStop()
-- Works once just after mission stop.
-- Send DISCONNECT message so we can fire the Helios Disconnect event
    socket.try(c:sendto("DISCONNECT\n", gHost, gPort))
    c:close()
end
</code>

* * * Known issues and work arounds * * *

The Keypress server means that you might get a firewall popup from the keyboard interface
when it attempts to find out if there is a Keypress receiver running on a remote PC
